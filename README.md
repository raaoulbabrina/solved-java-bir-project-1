<strong>Nice Number Programming:</strong>

Nice program ask user to enter three integers from keyboard (java console), the three integers represent left bound, right bound and arbitrary digit ‘m’, where left bound is less than right bound. Program should print all nice numbers in the given range that doesn’t contain digit ‘m’. The number is nice if its every digit is larger than the sum of digits which are on the right side of that digit. For example 741 is a nice number since 4&gt; 1, and 7&gt; 4+1. with digit m=2

Write a complete program in Java that Call<strong><u> only One method </u>(niceNumbers method) that will print all nice numbers excluding a given digit ‘m’ that also entered by user </strong>?

<strong>I</strong><strong>nput Sample :</strong>

Enter Left bound: 740

Enter Right bound:850 Enter digit to exclude it:2

<strong>Output sample:</strong>

Nice Numbers in Range Left=740, Right=850 with exclude digit m= 2 are: 740 741 750 751 760 810 830 831 840 841 843 850 Your method prototype is like this:

<strong>public static void</strong> niceNumbers(<strong>int </strong>left, <strong>int </strong>right, <strong>int </strong>dight) {

….

}
